My thought Process for the game i used to play a little and those are the things i remember about it
might add more later but the basic idea is to make a chess game:
Following the steps below (Doesnt have to be in the order but the UI is essential firstly to get the game going with its logic):

1.Make a board Essentially a 2D array of 8x8
2.Choose a board color
3.add chess pieces to the board (PNG)
4.add coordinates to the board like labels A-H 0-7
5.Make them clickable
6.add a move function to the pieces without any logic yet jus the movement
7.Represent the Board to keep tracking of the moves
8.implement the logic of the pieces (Starting from the pawn - Dont forget passant)
9.Add basic move validation
10.Update UI and Update game logic for invalid and valid moves
11.Add a turn system
12.Add a timer
13.Highlight valid moves (like in chess.com)
14.Add a check and checkmate system
15.Add a promotion system
16.Move History and maybe an undo for the fun but not optional
