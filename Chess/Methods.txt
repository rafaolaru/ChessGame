My thought Process for the game i used to play a little and those are the things i remember about it
might add more later but the basic idea is to make a chess game:
Following the steps below (Doesnt have to be in the order but the UI is essential firstly to get the game going with its logic):

1.Make a board Essentially a 2D array of 8x8
2.Choose a board color
3.add chess pieces to the board (PNG)
4.add coordinates to the board like labels A-H 0-7
5.Make them clickable
6.add a move function to the pieces without any logic yet jus the movement
7.Represent the Board to keep tracking of the moves
8.implement the logic of the pieces (Starting from the pawn - Dont forget passant)
9.Add basic move validation
10.Update UI and Update game logic for invalid and valid moves
11.Add a turn system
12.Add a timer
13.Highlight valid moves (like in chess.com)
14.Add a check and checkmate system
15.Add a promotion system
16.Move History and maybe an undo for the fun but not optional



Ok so for the game im a bit stuck on the enpassant move and acsteling i need to get the information of the pieces and their moves
and the logic behind it, it seems a bit weird because the enpassant move is only valid if the pawn moves two spaces and the other pawn is next to it
and it eats diagonally, i will get to the bottom of it.

and for the casteling i need to make sure there is no check and if it moved once it cannot castle just like in real chess
and the king and rook need to be in the right position and not blocked by any pieces
so need to figure how to do it
should be easy because i only check fewer pieces

for now i did 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8(enPassant and casteling not done yet),9,11,14,15(a bit off but i will get to it),16
and i will work on the rest later
